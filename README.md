##  Pulse Code and Delta Modulation Systems

This repository contains solutions and insights from **Lab-6: Pulse Code and Delta Modulation Systems** for the **EECS 4214: Digital Communications (Winter 2025)** course. The lab explores key concepts such as sampling, quantization, companding, and delta modulation.

## üîç Key Concepts Covered
- Sampling theory and spectrum analysis
- Uniform and non-uniform quantization (linear and non-linear PCM)
- ¬µ-law companding for improved dynamic range
- Delta modulation and signal reconstruction
- RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) evaluation for signal accuracy
